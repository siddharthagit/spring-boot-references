# Spring Boot Stand Alone App

Sample project demonstrating a simple stand alone java application in spring boot. It can be used for reference or for starting a new stand alone project.

## Getting Started

This project uses Spring Boot, Maven  to build a Spring Boot stand alone application which invokes a service and returns the result.

## How it works
This application contains a HelloService class with some methods to return data. The main application class calls the service class to display the data in the console.

This application also demonstrates how to customize the banner that is displayed in the console.

## Build Project

```sh
mvn install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
